## What is a Non-Fungible Token?
Fungible means to be the same or interchangeable. For example, Ethereum tokens, all the members of a particular token class, have the same value. The same can be said of Cardano tokens. Fungible tokens are interchangeable 1:1.

With this in mind, NFTs are unique; each one is different. Every single token has unique characteristics and values. The types of things that can be NFTs are collectible cards, artworks, airplane tickets, etc. They are all clearly distinguishable from one another and are not interchangeable. Think of Non-Fungible Tokens (NFTs) as rare collectibles; each has unique characteristics, unusual attributes, and most times, its metadata.
